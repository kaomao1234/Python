#Notepad Application
This is a simple Notepad application built using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to create, open, and save text files, as well as perform basic text editing operations such as copy, cut, and paste.

##Installation
To install the application, you can clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file. The application requires Python 3 and the Tkinter library to be installed on your machine.

You can install Tkinter using the following command:

```py
pip install tk
```
#Usage
To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```py
python notepad.py
```
This will launch the application, and you can start using it to create, open, and save text files. You can also perform text editing operations using the toolbar or the context menu.

#Development
If you want to contribute to the project or modify the code, you can use any text editor or IDE of your choice. The main logic of the application is contained in the notepad.py file, while the user interface is defined in the modules in the ui folder.

```
This will run all the tests in the test_notepad.py file.
